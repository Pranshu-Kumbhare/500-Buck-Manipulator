# 500-Buck-Manipulator
This app uses the AR feature to manipulate programmed currency of ₹500 rupee note in front of your android camera and converts it into ₹200.
# Introduction
AR apps allow you to define and recognise objects in the real-world and overlay additional/alternative content on top of them when they are viewed through a mobile phone or tablet camera screen.
# Tools I used
1. Unity 
2. Vuforia -a popular game development engine you can download for free from www.unity3d.com.
# Principle
a replacement image used to swap one playing card into another - the perfect AR magic trick! You can access further information in the Unity user manual at: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityManual.html
Simple and Clean Project
Thats all!! Cheers!
